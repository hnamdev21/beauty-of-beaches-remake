Meandering its way for 800 metres in length, it has been nicknamed “The People's Beach” since it was purchased by New Zealanders from a private owner after a crowdfunding campaign that received the support of some 40,000 people. A journey here is made all the more special from the fact Awaroa is only accessible on foot and by boat, with no road access. Scenic helicopter flights do overfly the beach without being able to land.",

After all, while many travelers share a love for the beach, not all beach lovers are looking for the same thing. But indeed, there are a few qualities most people can agree on when it comes to choosing the best of the best. And that's precisely why Grace Bay Beach is consistently voted among the best beaches worldwide — most recently by the UK-based Alpha Travel Insurance, who has dubbed our beloved Grace Bay No. 1 in the world. And that's one more reason to send your clients to the Turks & Caicos for their dream beach vacation.",
    "description2": "No matter what kind of beach you prefer, there's one thing most people can agree on: crystal-clear water is always a winner. And the water on Grace Bay is so impossibly clear, it may as well be a giant swimming pool. When you can wade neck-deep into the ocean and still see your toes — that's when you know you've found someplace special. We guarantee your clients will be raving about the ocean here for years to come.",

    "description": "Uig Sands Beach is a gorgeous Scottish beach on the southwestern side of the Isle of Lewis.  It is known for the Uig Chessmen.  In 1831, a set of 93 pieces from a Viking chess set were discovered in a stone chamber on this beach.  The chess pieces were made of walrus ivory and whales' teeth and they are thought to have been made in Norway in the 12th century.  The original chess pieces are on display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh and the British Museum in London.  But there is a giant - larger than life - replica of the King piece on display on the beach.",
